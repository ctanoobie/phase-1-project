      "description": "Small authentic Italian restaurant is located in Capital Hill area. This pasta joint is not only affordable (each plate less than $14 base) but the fresh pasta is handmade daily. Other popular handmade pasta establishments in Seattle are not as affordable by far. This is a must try for any traveler on a budget or pasta lover in general."
